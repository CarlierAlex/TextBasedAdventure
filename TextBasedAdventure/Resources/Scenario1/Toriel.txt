<INTRO:
Toriel: Sans, how is Frisk?
Sans: She's still unconsious, but out of harms way. Alphys is currently looking into the smaller wounds.
Toriel: Oh thank god!
Sans: We still need to find who did it. They might come back, since it sure looks like they had a grudge against her.
Toriel: I know that some are still anxious since the barrier is still in place ... but it's Frisk we are talking about.
Sans: It didn't stop them before we knew here.
/end>

<Q1:
- option 1: ask about Frisk
- option 2: comfort Toriel
/end>

<Q1-1:
Sans: You know where she was heading?
Toriel: She'd go to monster kid, but he called me asking if she was still coming. I tried looking for her, but didn't find her until you called.
Sans: But his house is in Snowdin.
Toriel: I know.
/end>

<Q1-2:
Sans: Don't worry, the kid has been through far worse situations.
Toriel: I know but...
Sans: No but's, she's going tibia fine.
Toriel: ...
/end>

<OUTRO:
Toriel: I'm off to Alphys. Care to join?
Sans: I'll see.
